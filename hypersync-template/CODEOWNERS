# HyperSync Registry — Code Owners
#
# Each team's official skills/ and rules/ directories should be owned
# by the team's leads. This ensures changes to official skills require
# approval from the right people.
#
# Playground directories intentionally have no owners, so anyone can
# contribute experimental skills. Promoting from playground to official
# triggers the CODEOWNERS review automatically.
